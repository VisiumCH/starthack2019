### Oceans Plastic Tracking and Catching

This project aims to use Optimization and Machine Learning techniques to handle oceans plastic littering, black tides and other passive pollutions.
The simulator based on the Parcels library allows to generate sources of pollutions. Optimization algorithms are then used to well position polluants filters.
